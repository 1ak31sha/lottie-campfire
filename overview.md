> A Lottie is a JSON-based animation file format that enables designers to ship animations on any platform as easily as shipping static assets. They are small files that work on any device and can scale up or down without pixelation.

## Why I loved lottie right off the bat ðŸ’¥

- The designers' intentions are most accurately reflected
- Easy to implement as a developer( as opposed to recreating the animations from scratch in CSS or D3 etc)
- Little to no CSS for the developer.
- Good documentation
- Animations are crisp and aren't too large (js bundle size)
- Open-source and free
- Designed by AirBNB
