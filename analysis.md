## Lottie Animation Campfire: ðŸ”¥ Analysis ðŸ”¥

So its all working pretty good eh? But what about the bundle size?

![bundlesize](./images/bundlesize.png)

The important stat to note here is the `Gzipped`. Thats whats going to be the actual size by the time a client has to download it when they are using our application in the browser

64kb, thats really not too bad. Plus...

We are lazy loading our routes anyways, so this code only get downloaded when the user reaches the page that contains the animation

```jsx
const EditUserProducts = React.lazy(
  () =>
    import(
      /* webpackChunkName: "EditUserProductsPage" */ "../../pages/EditUserProducts"
    )
);
```
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<br></br>

Wait, what about what you said before with the two animation files - how can we use just one?

What is a Marker?
> Marker is a way to represent a specific frame (or progress time) in Lottie animation by using a key name. You can imagine it as a pin on the map where you can use it to navigate to a specific location.

 When creating an animation, designers can mark playback points for developers to use without having to worry about keeping track of animation progress time or frames.

 ```jsx
 animationView.play(fromMarker: "touchDownStart",
                   toMarker: "touchDownEnd")
```
